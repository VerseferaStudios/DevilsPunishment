1. Make a scale to put the rooms in,
	first for constant size rooms 
	then varying given sized rooms
Discrepancy between prefab and groud scale, why




---------------------------------------------------

room1 _____
|
|
|____room

room1 |
	|
	|____room2

L doesnt matter zig zag is same distance

Keep 1 unit gap in between two rooms i the grid
ie, reduce the scale of each room by 0.25 units (?)
So, from a door reach oone of the corners then take the easy l route

Get a proper function to draw corridors from and to
like thefunction can be restrited to from and to having either x or z coordinates equal. Therefore you can have the point and instert into the function.

Have proper debugs at each stage of the function writing and test very frequently!!!!!!!!!!!!
