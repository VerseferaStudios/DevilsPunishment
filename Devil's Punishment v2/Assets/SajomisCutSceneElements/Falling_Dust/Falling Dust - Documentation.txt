This Falling Dust particle effect creates atmospheric dust particles falling from the ceiling. Additional effects are also included, such as a swinging light (shook from the explosion), camera shake and sound effects.

Load "Falling_Dust.unity" for an example scene (click the left mouse button to fire a mortar), or drag the required effect from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window.

When using the Camera_Shake prefab, first add the Prefab to the Hierarchy window and then set your chosen camera's transformations all to 0 in the Inspector (top right window). Then expand out the Camera_Shake node and drag the camera onto the revealed Animation node. Pressing the left mouse button will shake the camera.

Have fun!
